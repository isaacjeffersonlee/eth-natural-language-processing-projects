# ETH Natural Language Processing Projects

## Introduction
Here you will find the course projects I completed for the Natural Language Processing 
masters course which I undertook in my first term of my year abroad 
at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
The topics covered include:

1. Backpropagation
2. Conditional Random Fields
3. Machine transliteration with Finite-State Automata
4. Context-Free parsing with CKY.
5. Transformers (not included here).

## Structure
Each assignment has a theoretical section and a coding section.
You can find the questions in the questions dir, my code solutions
in the code dir and my typed theoretical solutions in the theory dir.

## Results
In each exercise I got above 90%, which put me in the top 10% of the class.
